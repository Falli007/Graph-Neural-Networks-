        "Fraud detection often involves identifying suspicious activity in transaction networks, where entities (like users, accounts) and interactions (like money transfers) form a graph. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can capture complex inter-entity relationships and detect fraud by learning structural patterns. In this project, I’ll use a GCN model on a synthetic transaction graph to classify nodes as fraudulent or not."
